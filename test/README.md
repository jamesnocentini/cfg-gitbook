We have a lot to cover in one day. So it would be great if you could get a head start to get your environment setup.

This workshop is made possible thanks to Mozilla. Tweet [@MozLDN](http://twitter.com/MozLDN) and thank them!

### Challenge

You may have heard recently the news about **Yo** app... If you haven't, check out this [article](http://mashable.com/2014/06/18/yo-app/) on Mashable.

The Challenge is to build a clone for Code First: Girls. We're thinking of calling it **Hey**. Of course, if you want to call it something else, it's your choice. **Yop**, **Hei**, **Mushroom**...

If you don't know much about ```html```, ```css``` and ```javascript``` don't worry, we'll cover the very basics.

### Hardware

Apple makes it relatively difficult for **PC** users to develop **iOS** apps. That's why cross-platform development is easier on a **Mac** than a **PC**. We highly recommend you to bring a **Mac**. That's mainly because we may not be able to help you if you have a **PC**.

### Development Environment

The Chrome devtools has great new features to emulate devices such as iPhones, iPads and Android devices.

[Download it here](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/#eula)


### Running on iOS devices

Download **Xcode** to run the app on emulators or devices. You can find it on the Apple App Store (on your Mac).

### Running on Android devices

To run Android Apps on the emulator and package the application for the Google Play Store you have to install the Android SDK.

[Download it here](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)

Emulators that ship with Android SDK are quite slow, that's why we'll use the open sourced Android Emulator from [Genymotion](http://www.genymotion.com/). Create a new account, choose the free plan and download the emulator.
